Program:
- to run this program, download this repository and make sure to also create a bin folder in the project folder as well. The object files will be put into the bin folder.

files:

1) client.c -> c file that handles the state machine for the client and the signal handling for Control-c

2) client.h -> header file for client functionality

3) LinkedList.c -> doubly linked list data structure. This data structure is used for the list of clients waiting to be talked to

4) LinkedList.h -> header file for doubly linked list data structure functionality

5) server.c -> Server implementation waits for a connection. once connection is established, it creates a thread to service the client

6) server.h -> header file for server functionality

7) wrapnetwork.c -> c file that has UNIX network wrapper functions

8) wrapnetwork.h -> header file for wrapper funcitons

Implementation:

- Max message size between clients is 8124 bytes
- Max message size between client and server is 512 bytes
- Everything works as expected
- Cntrl C only works in CHAT state:
	*if Cntrl C is pressed, user HAS to press enter.
	*When it has been entered, both clients close their connections to each other,
	 then both clients go back to the INFO state
	*if Cntrl C is pressed and entered in WAIT state or INFO state, it is ignored
- Client program only exits when the command "/quit" is enter. It works in any state
